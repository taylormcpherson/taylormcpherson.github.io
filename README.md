## Frameworks and Pre-Processors Used
- Code generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.3.
- Design created with help from Figma
- With help from Flexbox and FontAwesome Icons

## Room for Improvement (Todo list)
- Accessibility check: this site was created before I knew much about acessibility. I want to add in hover/focus states, and ensure it is fully acessible. Right now it is not.
- Up to date case studies. This website showcases my user experience research and design more than anything, however I currently spend most of my time as a front end developer.
